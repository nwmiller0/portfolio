<h1>Website Examples</h1>
<p>Here are some examples of sites I've built on my own and I've helped make.</p>

        <section id="button2">
        <h5> <a href="segway/segway.html" target="_blank" rel="bookmark" title="Segway Site">Segway Site</a> </h5>

        <p>This was one of the first websites I ever created. Even though this was for a class assignment I had a lot of fun building the site. Our objective with this site was to create a multipage website with properly structured HTML and CSS. We could choose from two different topics for the website content or create a site based on our own interests. I decided to choose from the segway option. Overall I was happy with how some of the elements on the site turned out. I was able to create a back to top button that worked properly. I also created and redesigned a logo for the top left of the site.</p>

        <p>Overall I really enjoyed the process of completing this project. I think we worked well as a team even after losing one of our members unfortunately. I mainly worked on the order submission form and the database. Most of my team didnâ€™t seem as comfortable with database skills or JavaScript skills so I decided to take that position to challenge myself. Overall I think I did ok with my final results. I think knowing what I know now I could make the order and cart system even better. </p>
